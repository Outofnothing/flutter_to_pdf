Map usual Flutter Widgets to Pdf Widgets, to enable creating PDF Documents, while working with normal Flutter Widgets. Flutter Textfields for example will map to PDF Text Widgets, so someone can easily enter some text in their app and in the end it will create a document which looks quite similiar to the Flutter View.
